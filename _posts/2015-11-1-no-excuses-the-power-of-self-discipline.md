  People want to achieve happiness and success in their life, but many fail, because they cannot find the discipline, the control and  why not the perseverance for achieving their goals.

  No excuses! - is a book about control and discipline, and the author gives a lot of examples from his own life, how to get this power, how can we not loose the control of life, how can we achieve self-discipline.

  The book has three parts, as follows: Self-Discipline and personal success; Self-Discipline in business, sales and finances, Self-Discipline and the good life.
Each part has a very good structured chapters, and each chapter starts with a wisely quoted passage.

  Part I - Self-discipline and personal success - gives us advices about responsibility, courage, persistence, goals.

  Part II - Self-discipline in business, sales, and finances. The aim of this part is to teach the reader how to succeed in his/her career, how to become the best in our work field, how to focus, and how to manage the time in our own advantage.
  
  Part III- Self-Discipline and the good life. This is my favourite part from the book, because it speaks about happiness, family and friendship, and gives us good advices on how to keep all this into a high level. In this part you will find ‘’five ingredients of happiness’’ of corse from the author point of view. And this ingredients are as follows: </br>
  1. health and energy; </br>
  2. happy relationships; </br> 
  3. meaningful work; </br>
  4. financial independence; 
  5. self-actualisation;
  
I enjoyed this book because for me personally, this was like a refreshing reading. 
It is a book that helps you, by giving a lot of examples, how to improve yourself  in relation with people, how to achieve responsibility, courage, persistence, and of course how to not find excuses for obtaining what you want in life.

At the end of each chapter you will find an ‘’action exercises’’ with questions and some wise advices for making your life a bit easier.

###Who should read this book?

This is a book for people who want to pursue their goals, for people who believe in themselves and for those who think that once you want something you can achieve, for people who know that life is not always easy, and all the time we have to sacrifice something for our purposes.</br>
